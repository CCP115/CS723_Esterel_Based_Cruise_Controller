# CS723_Esterel_Based_Cruise_Controller
 
A project was assigned to two person teams, where a Cruise Controller for a car was provided as a specification list, and implementation had to be created with
Esterel and C as the host language.

The report .docx file gives explanations for some high level FSMs and an explanation of each module within the Esterel and what they do.
